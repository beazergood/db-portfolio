This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

This repo is my portfolio demonstrating some of the technologies I like to work with.

I've taken inspiration from Josh Comeau's excellent blog that contains functional UI components within his posts. This is a great way to demonstrate and convey ideas from within a blog post.

I chose Next.js as it seems to be the most popular React framework thingy and it works well with Vercel which I really like.

Other packages I've included are what I consider to be part of my ideal stack.
- Storybook for building components in isolation and to take advantage of all it's benefits for building UI components.
- MDX: This allows me to create pages from mdx markdown files that can include functioning code components.
- Framer Motion: having discovered Framer just earlier this year I've immediately put it to use in all my projects. Framer motion is an excellent tool that enables you to create magic motion transitions between pages that give a very native and premium UX.

### TailwindCSS

- TailwindCSS for styling. I find tailwind really easy to learn and use. So far it can do everything I'm looking for in a CSS framework.
