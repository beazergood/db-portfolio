This repo is my portfolio demonstrating some of the technologies I like to work with.

- Next.js is my go to for building with React. It's really easy to use as a developer and the end UX is great.
- Storybook for building components in isolation and to take advantage of all it's benefits for building UI components.
- TailwindCSS for styling. I find tailwind really easy to learn and use. So far it can do everything I'm looking for in a CSS framework.
