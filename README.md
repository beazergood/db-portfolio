This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

This repo is my portfolio demonstrating some of the technologies I like to work with.

- Storybook for building components in isolation and to take advantage of all it's benefits for building UI components.
- MDX: This allows me to create pages from mdx markdown files that can include functioning code components.

### TailwindCSS

- TailwindCSS for styling. I find tailwind really easy to learn and use. So far it can do everything I'm looking for in a CSS framework.
